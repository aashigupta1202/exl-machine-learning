Twitter WeRateDogs project 

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis. Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you have to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.The dataset you have to wrangle is the tweet archive of Twitter user, also knownas WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorouscomment about the dog.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." This is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. 

Data Description 

This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) forall 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. Each tweet's retweet count and favourite ("like") count using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive by querying the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data.
